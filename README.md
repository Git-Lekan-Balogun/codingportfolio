# codingportfolio
Consists of tasks taken in bootcamp. Each task is annotated with comments to show understanding
Each assignment is separated into a folder of tasks. For example our assignment focusing on while loops will be located in "T#" and may be composed of a few different tasks. 
The most substantial tasks to view that shows a collection/amalgamation of coding understanding will be the Capstone Project - which are also labelled on the folder.
As time progresses I will be adding repositories or adding to this repository.
The goal of this repository is to find employment, ideally an apprenticeship so I can continue to learn what coding entails.
