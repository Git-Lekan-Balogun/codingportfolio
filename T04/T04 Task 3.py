#conversion.py
# In this task we need to declare some variables as integers as floats and convert them into other data types.

num1 = 99.23
num2 = 23
num3 = 150
string1 = "100"

print(int(num1))
print(float(num2))
print(str(num3))
print(int(string1))
print("")

print(f"{num1}\n{num2}\n{num3}\n{string1}")

# So i 've printed and converted the data types from one type to another. I had a few issues with the syntax,
# like remembering the mechanism or dynamic between \n and the print statement and f strings.
# Anyway, Printing ("") prints a line gap so printing ("\n") prints a gap and a new line, essentially 2 gaps.
